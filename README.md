*"From the searing singularity of the Big Bang, to the birth of stars and planets, and Earthâ€™s gathering from the dust of the cosmos; from the awakening of life in primordial oceans, to the slow unfolding of evolution giving rise to countless creatures, and the first spark of fire igniting upon the plains; from the etchings of hieroglyphs, to the dawning of thought, civilization was born.*

*Our ancestors, brick by brick, built the towering empires, engraved profound epics with their minds, and sang hymns of hope for a sacred past. Yet time eroded all things; great civilizations fell, and the world has long forgotten them."*

**Enhanced Stonebricks** aims to expand Minecraftâ€™s exploration mechanics based on stonebricks and enhance the utility of stonebricks.
